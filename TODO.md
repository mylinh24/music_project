# TODO: Implement VIP Access Control for Exclusive Songs

## Backend (Already Implemented)
- [x] songController.js: Check VIP status and filter exclusive songs for non-VIP users
- [x] song.js routes: Enforce access control on song endpoints
- [x] Return 403 error with upgrade message for exclusive song access by non-VIP users
- [x] profileController.js: Include vip field in /me endpoint response

## Frontend Updates
- [x] Update SongCard.jsx: Show upgrade prompt on play or click for exclusive songs if not VIP
- [x] Update SongDetailPage.jsx: Handle 403 error and show upgrade prompt instead of generic error
- [x] Update SongsPage.jsx: Remove filtering to show all songs, block on play
- [x] Update CategoryPage.jsx: Remove filtering to show all songs, block on play
- [x] Test with VIP and non-VIP accounts to ensure proper blocking and prompts

## Testing
- [ ] Verify non-VIP users see all songs in lists (including exclusive)
- [ ] Verify non-VIP users get upgrade prompt when trying to play or view details of exclusive songs
- [ ] Verify VIP users have full access to all songs
